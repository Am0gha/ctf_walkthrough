Mission  0x03:
The password of the user emma is in line 4069 of the file findme.txt

Soln:

-> We need to check how many lines are there in the findme.txt file

# angela@venus:~$ wc findme.txt
# 4618  4618 73888 findme.txt

-> The first 4618 shows the number of lines present in the findme.txt file
-> The second 4618 shows the number of words present in the findme.txt file
-> We need to print the 4069th line of the file.

# angela@venus:~$ tail -n 550 findme.txt
# fIvltaGaq0OUH8O
# 8e1adaa68b88d70
# 9eac49c7e0f4f6d
# debb716c32b9acf
# 9f49c87be422435
# ...

-> 'tail' command would print the last 10 lines of given file.
-> We used the '-n' arguement in order for the 'tail' command to print last 'n' lines, in our case 4618-4069=549 so 550 lines.
-> Try the first few lines as the password since we printed the last 550 lines it could be one of the first 2.
