pwd: havefun!

Mission 0x01:
User sophia has saved her password in a hidden file in this folder. Find it and log in as sophia.

Soln:

-> In linux files beginning with "." are hidden and cannot be listed when ls command is used
-> To discover such file use the same command with -a option

# hacker@venus:~$ ls -a
# .  ..  ...  .bash_logout  .bashrc  .myhiddenpazz  .profile  mission.txt  readme.txt

-> You can see file beginning with "." so .myhiddenpazz is what we need to check out for

# hacker@venus:~$ cat .myhiddenpazz
# Y1o645M3mR84ejc
