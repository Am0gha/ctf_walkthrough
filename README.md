# HackMyVM - Venus CTF Walkthroughs

Welcome to my collection of walkthroughs for the **HackMyVM Venus CTF series**. This repo documents my personal journey through each level of the challenge🚀.

### 🧠 What is Venus?

Venus is a CTF-style challenge hosted by [HackMyVM](https://hackmyvm.eu). Each level tests your practical Linux knowledge using riddle-like tasks. Testing your linux knowledge as a user, navigating the filesystem and using native commands to uncover clues and passwords.

### 📁 What's in this repo?

Each level has its own walkthrough — some are in-depth, others are brief but focused on the core solution. The goal is to capture the **thinking process**, not just the steps. Expect:

* A blend of logical deduction and brute force.
* Learning to use native Linux tools like `ls`, `grep`, `find`, `cut`, `uniq`, `sudo`, `base64`, and more.
* Commentary, command explanations as if I was explaining it to myself😅.

### 📌 Current Status

🧩 Completed: Levels 1 to 22
📚 Walkthroughs: All documented up to current level
🚧 Next: Finishing the final levels and organizing final cleanup

### 🗂 File Format

Each level walkthrough is stored as a plain text file. This format helps me revise stuff quickly. Once the Venus series is complete, I plan to rewrite the contents for easier browsing.
