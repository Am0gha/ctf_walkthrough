Mission 0x27:
Seems that ariel dont save the password for lola, but there is a temporal file.

Soln:

-> Whenever a text editor fails to save a file properly or due to some external factors you couldn't manually save the file beforehand, the text editor creates a file with the ".swp" extension.

-> These are 'swap' files (hence the extension '.swp') created by text editors such as vim to help recover unsaved data in case of crash or unexpected termination of the editor.

-> You can acces the files using text editors but it would be filled with gibberish. Unless you access it passing some additional arguements.

# ariel@venus:~$ vi -r .goas.swp

-> Here the '-r' arguement would instruct the vim text editor to recover the file from the available swap file (.swp).
-> You can see the contents of it as well clearly.
-> You can check the contents of the swap file using the cat command as well.

-> Now extracting all the available strings from the file.

# ariel@venus:/var/tmp/soln$ strings .goas.swp > pwd

-> I'm performing operations in /var/tmp directory as that is one of the directories in which we have all the permissions.

-> Now there will be a low of arrows and stuff so just keep the strings and remove anything extra, even that last pesky sentence. Something as shown below.

# ariel@venus:/var/tmp/soln$ cat pwd
# VVjqJGRrnfKmcgD
# bnQgcXYamhSDSff
# QsymOOVbzSaKmRm
# ...
# ppkJjqYvSCIyAhK

-> Using a tool called as 'hydra' on your local machine, you need to brute force ssh into 'ariel' machine, using the follow command.

# ┌──(amogha㉿Amogha)-[~/hackmyvm_venus]

-> "hydra -s 5000 -l lola -P pwd venus.hackmyvm.eu ssh"
	- '-s 5000' : to specify the port number through which you can access the machine (port 5000).
	- '-l lola' : to specify the user to be logged in as into the machine (user lola).
	- '-P pwd' : to specify the file containing the passwords to iterate through.
	- 'venus.hackmyvm.eu ssh' : to specify the method of logging into the machine (url -> venus.hackmyvm.eu).

-> Done!
