Mission 0x23:
The user isabel has left her password in a file in the /etc/xdg folder but she does not remember the name, however she has dict.txt that can help her to remember.

Note: You can follow the video by theshyhat for the same problem. Link given below. I could understand the method but it felt a little to clunky IMO. I'm a lazy bum with ADHD.

Soln:

-> This requires one to have some bash scripting knowledge.
-> There are 2 solutions to this question. One using something called as 'xargs' and the other way is to write a shell / bash script to iteratively search for the file using the contents present in the 'dict.txt' file.

-> I will be doing the scripting method.

-> Think of it as you are writing code in python. What would you do in python..??
-> You would take the file and save the words into a variable / a list and then using a loop you would check for the files existence... Crude but its the bare bone explanation that suits best.

###BASH_SCRIPT###

#!/bin/bash

dict="/var/tmp/soln/dict.txt"

while read -r word; do
        if [[ -r "/etc/xdg/$word" ]]; then
                echo "Found a file at /etc/xdg/$word"
        fi

done < "$dict"
######

-> All the bash scripts begins with the line '#!/bin/bash', the shebang. Used to instruct the operating system to use bash as a command interpreter.

-> Defined a variable by the name 'dict'. Storing the path of the 'dict.txt' file containing the list of file names out of which one exists.

-> Using a 'while' loop you would take an input using the 'read' command with '-r' arguement, meaning recursive input/multiline input.

-> Using 'if' condition to check if the said file exists or not in the '/etc/xdg' directory or not.
	- If it does, it would output a line to the bash "Found a file at /etc/xdg/<file_name>".

-> To close the 'if' condition you need to mention 'fi'

-> Now we would not be giving individual inputs of the contents of the 'dict.txt' file. Therefore you need to feed a file, hence we feed the 'dict' variable we defined beforehand locating the 'dict.txt' file and feeding it to the shell.

-> Give the script 'execute' permission using 'chmod'.

# lucia@venus:/var/tmp/soln$ chmod u+x script.sh

-> Run the script.

# lucia@venus:/var/tmp/soln$ ./script.sh
# Found a file at /etc/xdg/readme

-> Read the file.

# lucia@venus:/var/tmp/soln$ cat /etc/xdg/readme
# H5ol8Z2mrRsorC0


-> Done!!!
