The password of the clara user is found in a file modified on May 1, 1968.

Soln:

-> Yet again, we are haunted by the 'find' command.
-> What can I say... The more we try to run away and hide from this command, it 'find's us :-p.
-> Forgive me for that lame pun.. Moving on.

-> As ranted above in the first few lines, we need to use 'find' command but our refernce point to search the file is a date.
-> A little lesson on 'find' command when it comes to searching the files by timestamp.
	
	- A files timestamp changes when you make any changes to the file.
	- For some reason linux maintains the timestamp everytime you access the file.
	- And, yes when you create the file there is a timestamp to signify its time of creation.

-> Here they have mentioned that the file was last 'modified' on May 1, 1968. 1 year and 7 months before the unix timestamp.
-> So we need to use '-mtime' arguement, specifying the 'find' command to search for files MODIFIED 'n' seconds (or days??) from today.

# eva@venus:~$ find / -type f -mtime +12000 2>/dev/null
# /usr/lib/cmdo

-> Try using a number larger than 10000 to get any positive result.
-> '+12000' is the amount of days to be considered for searching. (Modified time older than 12000 days)

# eva@venus:~$ cat /usr/lib/cmdo
# 39YziWp5gSvgQN9

-> There you have it.
