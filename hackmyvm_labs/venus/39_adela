Mission 0x40:
User sky has saved her password to something that can be listened to.

Soln:

-> We have been through QR codes, Images, and now we have to deal with music.. Nice!!

-> As always, check the active directory for new files.

# adela@venus:~$ ls
# flagz.txt  mission.txt  wtf

-> Ok we have a file by the name 'wtf'. Let's check what kind of file it is using the "file" command.

# adela@venus:~$ file wtf
# wtf: ASCII text

-> That's odd, we expected a file containing audio but... Printing it's contents.

# adela@venus:~$ cat wtf
# .--. .- .--. .- .--. .- .-. .- -.. .. ... .

-> Morse code, clever..
-> Go to any online morese code translator and feed this output for it to translate. It's translation would be.

# PAPAPARADISE

-> That's it, we have the password. Do note that Morse code cannot differentiate between uppercase letters and lowercase letters. Therefore, try the password in both uppercase as well as lowercase as well.
