Mission 0x09:
The user isla has left her password in a zip file.

Soln:

-> Finally it seems we are done with the 'find' command.
-> Let's check if a zip file is present in the working directory.

# victoria@venus:~$ ls
# flagz.txt  mission.txt  passw0rd.zip

-> We do have a 'passw0rd.zip' file present in our working directory.
-> Let's "unzip" it.

# victoria@venus:~$ unzip passw0rd.zip
# Archive:  passw0rd.zip
# checkdir error:  cannot create pwned
#                  Permission denied
#                  unable to process pwned/victoria/passw0rd.txt.

-> **Forgot to mention that you cannot perform any sort of operations in any of the available directories except '/tmp' directories. Refer the 'readme' file present in the 'hacker' user which we started at the very beginning.
-> Create your very own directory in '/tmp' with as many '.' in the beginning and a name.

# victoria@venus:~$ mkdir /tmp/..amo01

-> Now copy the zip file into the directory and proceed to extract it.

# victoria@venus:~$ cp passw0rd.zip /tmp/..amo01
# victoria@venus:~$ cd /tmp/..amo01
# 
# victoria@venus:/tmp/..amo01$ ls
# passw0rd.zip
# 
# victoria@venus:/tmp/..amo01$ unzip passw0rd.zip
# Archive:  passw0rd.zip
#  extracting: pwned/victoria/passw0rd.txt
# 
# victoria@venus:/tmp/..amo01$ ls
# passw0rd.zip  pwned

-> Now access the file to fetch the passowrd for the 'isla' user.

# victoria@venus:/tmp/..amo01$ cat pwned/victoria/passw0rd.txt
