Mission 0x12:
The password of the user elena is between the characters fu and ck

Soln:

-> As the mission suggests user elena has saved the password in a file which:
	- starts with the letters 'fu'
	- ends with the letters 'ck'
  :-) Real mature....

-> We know the drill, lets check the active directory again...

# lucy@venus:~$ ls -a
# .  ..  .bash_logout  .bashrc  .profile  file.yo  flagz.txt  mission.txt

-> We have a file out of place called 'file.yo'.
-> Let's check the word count of the file.

# lucy@venus:~$ wc file.yo
#   606   606 12720 file.yo

-> Same here, 606 lines each containing a word.
-> So again using 'grep' command.

# lucy@venus:~$ grep '^fu.*ck$' file.yo
# fu4xZ5lIKYmfPLg9tck

-> We used 'grep' command with following arguements:
	- '^fu' → Line must start with "fu"
	- '.*'  → Zero or more characters (any characters in between)
	- 'ck$' → Line must end with "ck"

-> And there we go..
