Mission 0x13:
The user alice has her password is in an environment variable.

Soln:

-> Ok, we have an environment variable that we need to checkout for.
-> There are 2 ways to solve it.
-> One way is to check for the definition of environment variables in the '.bashrc' file.
-> Environment variable are defined using the keyword 'export', so search for 'export' string in the '.bashrc' file.

# elena@venus:~$ grep 'export' .bashrc
# #export GCC_COLORS='error=01;31:warning=01;35:note=01;36:caret=01;32:locus=01:quote=01'
# export PASS=Cgecy2MY2MWbaqt

-> As you can see we have an environment variable by the name 'PASS' which contains what seems to be a password.
-> You can just copy it and yeet this level outta your way.

OR

-> If you can print/list all the environment variables using a single command called 'printenv'

# elena@venus:~$ printenv
# SHELL=/bin/bash
# PWD=/pwned/elena
# LOGNAME=elena
# MOTD_SHOWN=pam
# HOME=/pwned/elena
# LANG=en_US.UTF-8
# .
# .
# .
# USER=elena
# PASS=Cgecy2MY2MWbaqt
# .
# .

-> You would get an output similar to this, a little bigger than this, scroll down untill you find something odd.
