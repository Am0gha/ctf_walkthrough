Mission 0x11:
The password of the user lucy is in the line that ends with 0JuAZ (these last 5 characters are not part of her password)

Soln:

-> Check for a file in the active directory.

# violet@venus:~$ ls
# end  flagz.txt  mission.txt

-> We have a file called 'end' lets check it out using 'wc' command and see how big of a file it is.

# violet@venus:~$ wc end
# 807   807 16947 end

-> 807 line and 807 words, making it a word per line. A lenghty file for sure.
-> Given the clue we have to search for the strings ending with the given string '0JuAZ' using 'grep' command.

# violet@venus:~$ grep '0JuAZ$' end
# OCmMUjebG53giud0JuAZ

-> We used the 'grep' command with the following arguements:
	- '0JuAZ$' -> '0JuAZ' is the substring to be searched present at the end of the string, denoted by '$'.
	- 'end' -> file name.

-> Using the regular expression we can narrow down our search results fitting our needs.

# NOTE**
# I'm pasting the example of grep command with its explanation down below for quick reference. 

EXAMPLE
       The following example outputs the location and contents of any line containing “f” and ending  in  “.c”,  within
       all files in the current directory whose names contain “g” and end in “.h”.  The -n option outputs line numbers,
       the  --  argument  treats  expansions of “*g*.h” starting with “-” as file names not options, and the empty file
       /dev/null causes file names to be output even if only one file name happens to be of the form “*g*.h”.

         $ grep -n -- 'f.*\.c$' *g*.h /dev/null
         argmatch.h:1:/* definitions and prototypes for argmatch.c

       The only line that matches is line 1 of argmatch.h.  Note that the regular expression syntax used in the pattern
       differs from the globbing syntax that the shell uses to match file names.
