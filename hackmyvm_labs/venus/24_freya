Mission 0x25:
User alexa puts her password in a .txt file in /free every minute and then deletes it.

Soln:

-> This question here poses a new topic in linux, called automation of tasks. Automation of task in linux can be done using a tool called 'crontab'.

-> Using the following crontab command you can see what is going on here.

# freya@venus:~$ crontab -l
# ....
# ....
# */1 * * * * freya echo "mxq9O3MSxxX9Q3S" > /free/beer.txt ; rm -f /free/beer.txt

-> Disclaimer: While solving this CTF I accidentally deleted the original crontab in which there were 2 jobs written. One of them was establishing a hard link to a file that already exists and the other one deletes it instantly every minute.

-> Hence I had to make it up for. As I forgot what the file to which the link was being created and the subsequent command. Therefore I tried to amend it in my own way.
