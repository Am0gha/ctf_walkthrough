Mission 0x18:
The password of user frida is in the password-protected zip (rockyou.txt can help you)

Soln:

-> Ok this is the level where you have to put your hacker hats on.
-> For the first time you need to use a tool inorder to crack the password.
-> The tool in question is john-the-ripper (not jack the ripper).
-> If you are using a linux based system you are well and good as you can use apt package manager to install it using the command.
# sudo apt-get install john -y
# You can search online for the installaion part.

-> Once you have installed it on to your local machine, now we need to download the zip file from the VM to your local machine.
-> You can convert the zip file to a base64 string and latter extract the zip file by translating it back from base64 to a file type.

# clara@venus:~$ ls
# flagz.txt  mission.txt  protected.zip

-> As you can see we have a zip file by the name 'protected.zip'. We cannot unzip it here in the server, because
	1. You don't have the permission to tamper with the users active directory.
	2. By default the tool is not installed on to the VM that you are using rn.

-> Now create a base64 dump of the zip file as shown below and copy the output.

# clara@venus:~$ base64 protected.zip
# UEsDBAoACQAAAIMzhVhzdJ8jHAAAABAAAAAZABwAcHduZWQvY2xhcmEvcHJvdGVjdGVkLnR4dFVU
# CQAD9pkPZvaZD2Z1eAsAAQQAAAAABAAAAACc/uQ52ED8vSTlcON+hM2vBK6cXas6YlcIf/9rUEsH
# CHN0nyMcAAAAEAAAAFBLAQIeAwoACQAAAIMzhVhzdJ8jHAAAABAAAAAZABgAAAAAAAEAAACkgQAA
# AABwd25lZC9jbGFyYS9wcm90ZWN0ZWQudHh0VVQFAAP2mQ9mdXgLAAEEAAAAAAQAAAAAUEsFBgAA
# AAABAAEAXwAAAH8AAAAAAA==

-> Now head over to you local machine and open up a file using any editor of your choice and paste the output and save it.
-> In my case I've saved it in the 'protected.b64' file.

# ┌──(amogha㉿Amogha)-[~/hackmyvm_venus]
# └─$ ls
# data.txt       decryption.hash  pic.hash  pwned  test.jpeg  trash
# decrypted.mp4  file.b64         protected.b64

-> Now decode the base64 code using 'base64' command with '-d' arguement and direct the output to it's original file name "protected.zip".

# ┌──(amogha㉿Amogha)-[~/hackmyvm_venus]
# └─$ base64 -d protected.b64 > protected.zip
#
# ┌──(amogha㉿Amogha)-[~/hackmyvm_venus]
# └─$ ls
# data.txt       decryption.hash  pic.hash  pwned  test.jpeg  trash
# decrypted.mp4  file.b64         protected.b64  protected.zip

-> As you can see, we have a the zip file loaded onto our local machine.
-> Now use the 'zip2john' command to extract the password hash of the zip file by feeding the zip file you want to crack as in input arguement.

# ┌──(amogha㉿Amogha)-[~/hackmyvm_venus]
# └─$ zip2john protected.zip
# ver 1.0 efh 5455 efh 7875 protected.zip/pwned/clara/protected.txt PKZIP Encr: 2b chk, TS_chk, cmplen=28, decmplen=16, 
# crc=239F7473 ts=3383 cs=3383 type=0
# protected.zip/pwned/clara/protected.txt:$pkzip$1*2*2*0*1c*10*239f7473*0*53*0*1c*3383*9cfee439d840fcbd24e570e37e84cdaf0
# 4ae9c5dab3a6257087fff6b*$/pkzip$:pwned/clara/protected.txt:protected.zip::protected.zip

-> '$pkzip$1*2*2*0*1c*10*239f7473*0*53*0*1c*3383*9cfee439d840fcbd24e570e37e84cdaf04ae9c5dab3a6257087fff6b*$/pkzip$'
-> This entire thing here is the password hash. You can redirect the output to a file:

# ┌──(amogha㉿Amogha)-[~/hackmyvm_venus]
# └─$ zip2john protected.zip > protected.hash
# ver 1.0 efh 5455 efh 7875 protected.zip/pwned/clara/protected.txt PKZIP Encr: 2b chk, TS_chk, cmplen=28, decmplen=16, 
# crc=239F7473 ts=3383 cs=3383 type=0

-> Now we need to supply the password hash file that you generated to the 'john' command with a file called 'rockyou.txt'.

# ┌──(amogha㉿Amogha)-[~/hackmyvm_venus]
# └─$ john protected.hash --wordlist=/usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt
# Using default input encoding: UTF-8
# Loaded 1 password hash (PKZIP [32/64])
# No password hashes left to crack (see FAQ)

-> Once the process is finished you can use the command 'john --show <pwd_hash_file_name>' to show the password.

# ┌──(amogha㉿Amogha)-[~/hackmyvm_venus]
# └─$ john --show protected.hash
# protected.zip/pwned/clara/protected.txt:pass123:pwned/clara/protected.txt:protected.zip::protected.zip
# 
# 1 password hash cracked, 0 left

-> Voila! There you have it. 'pass123'.
-> Unzip it using 'unzip' command and get the password for the user 'frida'.

# ┌──(amogha㉿Amogha)-[~/hackmyvm_venus]
# └─$ unzip protected.zip
# Archive:  protected.zip
# [protected.zip] pwned/clara/protected.txt password:
#  extracting: pwned/clara/protected.txt
# 
# ┌──(amogha㉿Amogha)-[~/hackmyvm_venus]
# └─$ ls
# data.txt       decryption.hash  pic.hash       protected.hash  pwned ...
# 
# ┌──(amogha㉿Amogha)-[~/hackmyvm_venus]
# └─$ cat pwned/clara/protected.txt
# Ed4ErEUJEaMcXli

*NOTE:
When you give the password hash file that you have generated along with the 'rockyou.txt' file, the 'john' command access the 'rockyou.txt' file, which is a dictionary file containing the hashed value against its original text value.

What you are essentially doing is a textbook dictionary attack (sort off... idk?) onto a zip file to guess the most commonly used passwords. Nothing much complicated.
