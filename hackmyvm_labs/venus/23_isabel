Mission 0x24:
The password of the user freya is the only string that is not repeated in different.txt

Soln:

-> This problem here requires us to find a string that hasn't been repeated in the "different.txt" file. 

-> The solution is a mix of cat,uniq and grep command. (Get a 'grep' over it... Get it??)

-> First what we want is to store the sorted version of the file. As you can check the file how many lines / words it holds.

-> Using the following command we will create a sorted file with uniq strings and their respective counts.

# isabel@venus:~$ cat different.txt | sort | uniq -c > /var/tmp/soln/isabel_pwd_file

-> Now that we have the sorted file, it would be in the following fomat.

# 2 00010b0765c11cc
# 2 00205d587090943
# 2 00213023c9abfbe
# 2 002b4e53be7876f
# 2 0034acdf29fb163
# ...
# ...

-> '<count> <string>' is the format. These are sorted in the manner that starting with numbers moving on to the alphabets.

-> Now we need to find a string whose count is 1, we can do so using the 'grep' command.

# isabel@venus:/var/tmp/soln$ grep '1 ' isabel_pwd_file
#       1 EEDyYFDwYsmYawj

-> This level was as simple as that.
