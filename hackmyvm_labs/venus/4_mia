Mission 0x05:
It seems that the user camila has left her password inside a folder called hereiam

Soln:

-> We need to access the hereiam directory to fetch camila's password.

# mia@venus:~$ ls
# flagz.txt  mission.txt

-> As you can check, there is no directory by the name 'hereiam' in our active directory.
-> We need to use find command to search for this directory by name.

# mia@venus:~$ find / -type d -name hereiam 2>/dev/null
# /opt/hereiam

-> We used the find command with following arguements:
	- '/' -> to specify the target directory to search in. In our case, every available directory in the linux distro.
	- '-type d' -> to specify the type of the search object, in our case search object is of type directory (d)
	- '-name hereiam' -> to specify the name of the directory / search object.
	- '2>/dev/null' -> to redirect all the errors generated to 'null' directory in /dev

-> *Every known directory is stored in the root (/) directory. It is a top level directory
-> Access the directory and print the file.

# mia@venus:~$ cd /opt/hereiam
# mia@venus:/opt/hereiam$ ls
#

-> By the looks of it there is nothing stored in the '/opt/hereiam' directory, but lets check for hidden files.

# mia@venus:/opt/hereiam$ ls -a
# .  ..  .here

-> There we go! We found a hidden file '.here'. Let's open it up.

# mia@venus:/opt/hereiam$ cat .here
# F67aDmCAAgOOaOc

-> Voila! We have our password for the next user camila.
