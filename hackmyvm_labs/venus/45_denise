Mission 0x46:
The user zora is screaming doas!

Soln:

-> 'doas' sounds like a command, a quick google search gives me the results for wikipedia page for archlinux, where they have mentioned it's functionality. Which is :

>>"Like sudo, doas is used to assume the identity of another user on the system."

-> So it is used in a similar way sudo is used but it is much smaller in size and easier to set up, assuming that the command mentioned should be executed with root privileges.

-> I'm yet to understand this "doas" command, as it is very vaguely explained as far as the sources I went through, anywho...

-> "doas" is kinda substitute for the "sudo" user, whereas the "sudo" is the 'be all do all' of the linux, to limit the users privilege while letting them use some functionality / commands with limited or selective root privilege.. ig..??

-> Syntax: doas <command>
	- Example: doas cat /etc/passwd

-> Let's try to change into "zora" user using the "doas" command.

# denise@venus:~$ doas -su zora
# doas (denise@venus) password: pFg92DpGucMWccA
# zora@venus:/pwned/denise$

-> That's it..?? Seriously..?? One google search away. Anyways, link for the doas funcion's documentation is down below :
> https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Doas

-> Feed free to read it. Now back to the problem. Let's go to zora's home directory, and check the contents of the directory.

# zora@venus:/pwned/denise$ cd
# zora@venus:~$ ls
# flagz.txt  mission.txt  zora_pass.txt

-> Open the "zora_pass.txt" file and save the passwords somewhere else on you local machine.

# zora@venus:~$ cat zora_pass.txt
# BWm1R3jCcb53riO
