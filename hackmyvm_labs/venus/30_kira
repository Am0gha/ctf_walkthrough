Mission 0x31:
The user veronica visits a lot http://localhost/waiting.php

Soln:

-> This requires the user to send a custom request using the curl command.
-> On accessing the webapge the following message is displayed

# kira@venus:~$ curl -vv localhost/waiting.php
# *   Trying 127.0.0.1:80...
# * Connected to localhost (127.0.0.1) port 80 (#0)
# > GET /waiting.php HTTP/1.1
# > Host: localhost
# > User-Agent: curl/7.88.1
# > Accept: */*
# >
# < HTTP/1.1 200 OK
# < Server: nginx/1.22.1
# < Date: Fri, 06 Jun 2025 14:37:44 GMT
# < Content-Type: text/html; charset=UTF-8
# < Transfer-Encoding: chunked
# < Connection: keep-alive
# <
# 
# Im waiting for the user-agent PARADISE.
# * Connection #0 to host localhost left intact 

-> If you notice the message it is returning us, it is waiting for the user-agent PARADISE.
-> We just need to adjust our http request by sending a custom header.

# kira@venus:~$ curl -vv -H "User-Agent: PARADISE" http://localhost/waiting.php
# *   Trying 127.0.0.1:80...
# * Connected to localhost (127.0.0.1) port 80 (#0)
# > GET /waiting.php HTTP/1.1
# > Host: localhost
# > Accept: */*
# > User-Agent: PARADISE
# >
# < HTTP/1.1 200 OK
# < Server: nginx/1.22.1
# < Date: Fri, 06 Jun 2025 14:39:07 GMT
# < Content-Type: text/html; charset=UTF-8
# < Transfer-Encoding: chunked
# < Connection: keep-alive
# <
# 
# QTOel6BodTx2cwX
# * Connection #0 to host localhost left intact 

-> Voila! We got the code to the next level.

*Note to self: I'm not aware on concepts related to curl therefore need to learn the stuff behind the command. ;_;
