Mission 0x08:
The user victoria has left her password in a file in which the owner is the user violin.

Soln: 

-> Again it seems the question is giving hints of using the 'find' command.
-> This time we are given the owner of the file instead of it's name or size.

# eleanor@venus:~$ find / -type f -user violin 2>/dev/null
# /usr/local/games/yo

-> We yet again used the 'find' command with the following arguements:
	- '-user violin' -> to specify the owner user of the search object.

-> Access the file.

# eleanor@venus:~$ cat /usr/local/games/yo
