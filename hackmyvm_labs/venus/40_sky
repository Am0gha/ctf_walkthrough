Mission 0x41:
User sarah uses header in http://localhost/key.php.

Soln:

-> This is another question where our knowledge regarding 'curl' command is checked. The question suggests that user sarah uses header in 'localhost/key.php'. Indicating there might be a password hidden in the page 'key.php'.

-> Let's just use curl to check the "localhost/key.php"

# sky@venus:~$ curl localhost/key.php
# 
# Key header is true?

-> It is suggesting something with respect to a header by the name 'key' being true. So let's curl it with "-v" to know more.

# sky@venus:~$ curl -v localhost/key.php
# *   Trying 127.0.0.1:80...
# * Connected to localhost (127.0.0.1) port 80 (#0)
# > GET /key.php HTTP/1.1
# > Host: localhost
# > User-Agent: curl/7.88.1
# > Accept: */*
# >
# < HTTP/1.1 200 OK
# < Server: nginx/1.22.1
# < Date: Sun, 20 Jul 2025 10:22:04 GMT
# < Content-Type: text/html; charset=UTF-8
# < Transfer-Encoding: chunked
# < Connection: keep-alive
# <
# Key header is true?
# * Connection #0 to host localhost left intact

-> As you can see once you curl the localhost/key.php, it sends a 'GET' request to the url. 'GET' request fetches the contents from the server where the url points to.

-> Now we need to play with it a little, let's try sending some data, or a header precisely called as "key" holding the value "true".

# sky@venus:~$ curl -v -X POST -H "key:true" localhost/key.php
# *   Trying 127.0.0.1:80...
# * Connected to localhost (127.0.0.1) port 80 (#0)
# > POST /key.php HTTP/1.1
# > Host: localhost
# > User-Agent: curl/7.88.1
# > Accept: */*
# > key:true
# >
# < HTTP/1.1 200 OK
# < Server: nginx/1.22.1
# < Date: Sun, 20 Jul 2025 10:16:31 GMT
# < Content-Type: text/html; charset=UTF-8
# < Transfer-Encoding: chunked
# < Connection: keep-alive
# <
# 
# * Connection #0 to host localhost left intact
# LWOHeRgmIxg7fuS

-> To send some data to the url we use the "POST" request. Now that we sent a "POST" request with the "key:true" as the value, we got something that looks like a password.

-> That's it folks.
