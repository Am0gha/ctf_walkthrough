Mission 0x10:
The password of the user violet is in the line that begins with a9HFX (these 5 characters are not part of her password.).

Soln:

-> As they haven't mentioned what file to look it up in, we assume that the file is present in the working directory so checking it.

# isla@venus:~$ ls
# flagz.txt  mission.txt  passy

-> There is a file called passy, which is the file we should search the password in.
-> They have mentione that the password is persent in the file at the line beginning with the string 'a9HFX'.
-> This question requires the use of 'grep' command.
-> * 'grep' command is used to search a string or a pattern in a file of strings or text files.

-> Let's check the word count in the "passy" file.

# isla@venus:~$ wc passy
#  808   808 16968 passy

-> There are about 808 lines in the file and 808 words as well.
-> Using 'grep' command we need to build a regex to search the particular string at the very beginning of each line.

# isla@venus:~$ grep '^a9HFX' passy
# a9HFXWKINVzNQLKLDVAc

-> We used 'grep' command with the following arguements:
	- "'^a9HFX'" -> specifying the 'grep' to find the line that begins with the follwing string. '^' symbol is used to denote 'begins with' part in the command.
	- 'passy' -> specifying the file to search in.

-> Excluding the a9HFX part copy and use the passowrd for accessing the 'violet' user
