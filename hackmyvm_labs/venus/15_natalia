Mission 0x16:
The password of user eva is encoded in the base64.txt file.

Soln:

-> In this level we have a file base64.txt file which is encoded into some format.

# natalia@venus:~$ ls
# base64.txt  flagz.txt  mission.txt  nataliapass.txt

-> Let's check the word count of the file.

# natalia@venus:~$ wc base64.txt
#  1  1 25 base64.txt

-> Nothing to worry about we have a single line with just one word. Further prying it open..

# natalia@venus:~$ cat base64.txt
# dXBzQ0EzVUZ1MTBmREFPCg==

-> The contents are encoded into base64 format. A tell tale sign if some text is in base64 format is look for '=' signs at the end, or anywhere.
-> Therefore we need to decode the text, which should give us our password in straight text format.
-> Using 'base64' command to decode the contents.

# natalia@venus:~$ base64 -d base64.txt
# upsCA3UFu10fDAO

-> '-d' arguement in 'base64' command to tell the base64 command to decode the given contents from base64 to ASCII text format.
