Mission 0x37:
The user julie has created an iso with her password.

-> Check the active directory for iso files.

# alora@venus:~$ ls
# flagz.txt  mission.txt  music.iso

-> We have 'music.io'. Convert it into base64 using the base64 command and paste the output onto a file on your local machine.

-> In my case I saved it in the '~/hackmyvm_venus/alora' directory. Be carefull, and try to do it in a "nano" or "gedit" file editor, tried doing it on vim and it just lagged or hanged the instance.

-> Extract the iso file using the following command.

# cat music.b64 | base64 -d > music.iso

-> This would create a 'music.iso' file onto your local machine. Using the file explorer on your machine, you can navigate into the iso file and extract the contents out of it.

-> you would find a 'music.zip' file inside the iso file. Extract it outside of the iso file using 'extract' option from extra options in file explorer.

-> Extract the zip file and you would find the 'pwned' directory. It has 'alora' folder inside of it, which consists of a text file with the password in it by the name 'music.txt'.

-> Open it and you would find the password for the 'julie' user.
