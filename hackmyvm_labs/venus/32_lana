Mission 0x33:
The user noa loves to compress her things.

Soln:

-> On listing the active directory there is a zip.gz file lying around

# lana@venus:~$ ls
# flagz.txt  mission.txt  zip.gz

-> Cannot edit in the active directory due to limited permissions assigned to the users.
-> Create a new user in '/tmp' directory and copy the zipped file over there.

# lana@venus:~$ mkdir /tmp/..lana
# lana@venus:~$ cp zip.gz /tmp/..lana/

-> Extract it using gzip or tar (check the type of zip file using 'file' command, it showed me it was a POSIX tar gnu file???)

# lana@venus:~$ tar -xvf zip.gz
# pwned/lana/zip

-> Open the zip file and voila! you got yourself the password for the next level.

# lana@venus:/tmp/..lana/pwned/lana$ cat zip
