Mission 0x28:
The user celeste has left a list of names of possible .html pages where to find her password.

Soln:

-> First let's check out the current directory for any new files.

# lola@venus:~$ ls -a
# .  ..  .bash_logout  .bashrc  .profile  flagz.txt  mission.txt  pages.txt

-> As you can see there is a file called pages.txt, let's check the word count of the file.

# lola@venus:~$ wc pages.txt
#  136  135 1438 pages.txt

-> There are about 136 pages to check for. There are 2 ways to do so.
	- One way is to copy the pages file to '/tmp' directory and add html at the end of each word in the pages.txt and write a script to access each one of them.
	- Or, whenever someone hosts a html file locally they are always stored in the '/var/www/html' directory in case of linux distributions. Therefore we can headover there and try all possible html files present in that directory.

-> We will do it the easy way out.
-> Head over to the '/var/www/html' directory and list check for it's content.

# lola@venus:~$ cd /var/www/html
# lola@venus:/var/www/html$ ls
# cebolla.html  index.html  index.nginx-debian.html  key.php  method.php  waiting.php

-> There is 'index.html' and then there is 'cebolla.html'. Let's access them both.

# lola@venus:/var/www/html$ curl localhost/index.html
# 33EtHoz9a0w2Yqo
# lola@venus:/var/www/html$ curl localhost/cebolla.html
# VLSNMTKwSV2o8Tn

-> If you can recall the last challenge, the output of 'index.html' matches the one where we just used 'curl localhost'.
-> Hence it cannot be the password of the 'celeste' user.
-> Therefore the 'cebolla.html' should contain the password. Let's check it using "hydra" command.

-> If this doesn't sound like bingo! I do not know what does...

# VLSNMTKwSV2o8Tn

-> If you want to know do it the other way around, adding html at the end, writing a script to curl each one of them, you can do so by following the tutorial linked below by 'theshyhat' channel in youtube.
