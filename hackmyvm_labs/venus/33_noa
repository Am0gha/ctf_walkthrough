Mission 0x34:
The password of maia is surrounded by trash

Soln:

-> Always, and I say it again. ALWAYS!!! check the working directory for any hidden files. 'ls -a' is your best friend.

# noa@venus:~$ ls -a
# .  ..  .bash_logout  .bashrc  .profile  flagz.txt  mission.txt  trash

-> And there it is, the trash file!!
-> Before openning the file, if you are patient enough, try running the following few commands to see first hand what you're dealing with.
	- 'wc trash'
	- 'file trash'
-> Be my guest and jump the gun if you are too eager but all you would find is gibberish and I mean it.
	- 'cat trash'

-> You would get some binary gibberish (not the gender!!).
-> Try searching for a string or 'strings'. ;-|)
-> To be more precise, count the length of the password of each level and you would find that it is of length 16 characters.

# noa@venus:~$ strings -14 trash
# \nh1hnDPHpydEjoEN

-> Here the 'strings' command was used with the arguement: '-14' specifying the minimum legth of the string to be returned.
-> i.e. 'strings' should return strings from the trash file with length of atleast 14 characters and no max length cap.
-> '\n' is the exit sequence for new line, so avoid it and there you have it...

* It's escape sequence, my alzheimer infested brain does some mistakes here and ther every now and then.
