Mission 0x07:
The user eleanor has left her password in a file that occupies 6969 bytes.

Soln:

-> Again by the looks of it, it seems another question for using find command.
-> But this time instead of the name, we are givent he size of the file.

# luna@venus:~$ find / -size 6969c 2>/dev/null
# /usr/share/moon.txt

-> We used the 'find' command with the following arguements:
	- '-size 6969c' -> to specify the size of the file / search object. the 'c' after the number denotes that the object's size is to be measured in bytes. (A suffix for bytes)

# luna@venus:~$ cat /usr/share/moon.txt
# UNDchvln6Bmtu7b
