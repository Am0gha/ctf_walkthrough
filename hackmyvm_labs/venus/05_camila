Mission 0x05:
The user luna has left her password in a file inside the muack folder.

Soln:

-> Let's see if we can find the muack folder in the current directory.

# camila@venus:~$ ls
# flagz.txt  mission.txt  muack

-> We do have a directory called 'muack'. Checking it out.

# camila@venus:~$ cd muack
# camila@venus:~/muack$ ls
# 1    12   140  161  182  202  223  244  265  286  306  327  348  369  39   41   430  451  472  493  513  534  60  81 ..

-> There are about 549 directories present inside the 'muack' folder.
-> We cannot traverse each of 549 folders to search for a file, therefore using 'find' command we will try to find a file in current directory.

# camila@venus:~/muack$ find ./ -type f 2>/dev/null
# ./111/111/muack

-> We used the find command with the following attributes:
	- './' -> to specify the search location to be in current directory (./)
	- '-type f' -> to specify the type of search object. In our case, file (f) as mentioned in the question.

-> We got the following output, saying there is a file in './111/111/' directory.

# camila@venus:~/muack$ cd 111/111
# camila@venus:~/muack/111/111$ ls
# muack
# camila@venus:~/muack/111/111$ cat muack
