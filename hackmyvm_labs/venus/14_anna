Mission 0x15:
Maybe sudo can help you to be natalia.

Soln:

-> The description of the level is kinda new for me as well.
-> Looks like it has something to do with 'sudo' command.
-> Even I couldn't clear the level without some assitance from theshyhat. Checkout his youtube channel for vidoes under the titles "HackMyVM - Venus CTF labs - Level xx" for additional guidance.

-> Apparently in some levels, users are given permissions to run certain commands as sudo users. Although limited privilege is given, knowing what commands a user can be able to execute as root using sudo goes a long way.

-> To check what are the commands you can execute with sudo privilege we use the following command.

# anna@venus:~$ sudo -l
# Matching Defaults entries for anna on venus:
#     env_reset, mail_badpass, secure_path=/usr/local/sbin\:/usr/local/bin\:/usr/sbin\:/usr/bin\:/sbin\:/bin,
#     use_pty
#
# User anna may run the following commands on venus:
#     (natalia) NOPASSWD: /bin/bash

-> As you can see we can run '/bin/bash' as 'natalia' user.
-> 'sudo -l' lists all the command that you can execute using sudo.

# anna@venus:~$ sudo -u natalia /bin/bash
# natalia@venus:/pwned/anna$

-> '-u' is used to specify which user should sudo execute the command as, in our case the user 'natalia'
-> and '/bin/bash' is the command to be executed as natalia user.

-> Once you are logged in as natalia user using the '/bin/bash' go to natalia's home directory, and look for the password file.

# natalia@venus:/pwned/anna$ cd
# natalia@venus:~$ ls
# base64.txt  flagz.txt  mission.txt  nataliapass.txt

-> Open the 'flagz.txt' file and enter the flag in the website to save your progress online.
