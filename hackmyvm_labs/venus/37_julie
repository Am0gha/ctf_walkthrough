Mission 0x38:
The user irene believes that the beauty is in the difference.

Soln:

-> Difference is a command used to find the difference between the contents of given 2 files. The command in question to be used it 'diff'.

-> Let's check the active directory for any files to find difference between.

# julie@venus:~$ ls
# 1.txt  2.txt  flagz.txt  mission.txt

-> We have 2 files to check out for. '1.txt' and '2.txt'. You can see check the manual for the 'diff' command using : "man diff" command.

# julie@venus:~$ diff 1.txt 2.txt
# 174c174
# < 8VeRLEFkBpe2DSD
# ---
# > aNHRdohjOiNizlU

-> As you can see there is a difference in both the files, or a line differs in both the files. Copy the output onto your local machine, as we have 2 lines or 2 passwords that we need to try out for the irene user.

-> Copying the output to our local machine we need to use hydra to find the right password among the both. By using the following command:

# ┌──(amogha㉿Amogha)-[~/hackmyvm_venus/julie]
# └─$ hydra -s 5000 -l irene -P pwd venus.hackmyvm.eu ssh
# ...
# [5000][ssh] host: venus.hackmyvm.eu   login: irene   password: 8VeRLEFkBpe2DSD
# ...

-> There we go, we found the right password. That is...
# 8VeRLEFkBpe2DSD
