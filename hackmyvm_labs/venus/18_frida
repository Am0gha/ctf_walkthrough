Mission 0x19:
The password of eliza is the only string that is repeated (unsorted) in repeated.txt.

Soln:

-> Check the working directory for the mentioned file.

# frida@venus:~$ ls
# flagz.txt  mission.txt  repeated.txt

-> Checking the word count of the file to see if it is ok to open it.

# frida@venus:~$ wc repeated.txt
# 4591  4591 73456 repeated.txt

-> Nuh uh...
-> Ok so we need to find the password of eliza which is the only string that is repeated in an unsorted repeated.txt file.
-> To find the unique words present in a file we use the 'uniq' command along with an arguement as shown below.

# frida@venus:~$ cat repeated.txt | uniq -c
# 1 d759de7188e8d0e
# 1 34457a46b3251b9
# 1 1cea2435c4ca436
# 1 973a0eb3eb8c9e8
# ...

-> Outputs the times the string has been repeated in the entire file along with the string in question.
-> Now create a directory in '/tmp' and dump the output into a txt file.

# frida@venus:~$ mkdir /tmp/..tec
# frida@venus:~$ cat repeated.txt | uniq -c > /tmp/..tec/test

-> Navigate to the directory.

# frida@venus:~$ cd /tmp/..tec/

-> Using the 'grep' command search for number greater than 1.

# frida@venus:/tmp/..tec$ grep -v 1 test
#       2 Fg6b6aoksceQqB9

-> Here the '-v' arguement is passed to do 'invert match' i.e. exclude the strings or lines containing the given string / character. In our case it was '1' which I mentioned right after the arguement.
-> Voila there you have the password!.
