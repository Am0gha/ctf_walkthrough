# In the previous level, we had access to the iris machine. Check the home directory for the password text for iris user.

Mission 0x21:
User eloise has saved her password in a particular way.

Soln:

-> Ok so let's check the home directory.

# iris@venus:~$ ls
# eloise  flagz.txt  irispass.txt  mission.txt

-> We have a file by the name 'eloise'. Let's take a peek at it.

# iris@venus:~$ cat eloise
# /9j/4AAQSkZJRgABAQEAYABgAAD/4RDSRXhpZgAATU0AKgAAAAgABAE7AAIAAAAEc01MAIdpAAQA
# AAABAAAISpydAAEAAAAIAAAQwuocAAcAAAgMAAAAPgAAAAAc6gAAAAgAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
# AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
# AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
# AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA.....
# AooooAKKKKACiiigAooooAKKKKACiiigAooooAKKKKACiiigAooooAKKKKACiiigAooooAKKKKAP
# /9k=

-> Right of the bat, it looks like a base64 encoded file. Cuz it ends with '='.
-> Let's decode it, and dump its output to a file.
-> Create a new folder and dump the decoded output in that directory.

# iris@venus:~$ mkdir /tmp/..eloise
# iris@venus:~$ base64 -d eloise > /tmp/..eloise/decoded

-> Navigate to the directory where the output is saved and check it's file type.

# iris@venus:~$ cd /tmp/..eloise/
# iris@venus:/tmp/..eloise$ file decodeddecoded: JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01, resolution (DPI), density 96x96, 
# segment length 16, Exif Standard: [TIFF image data, big-endian, direntries=4], baseline, precision 8, 394x102, 
# components 3

-> We rang a lottery right here. It clearly mentions that it is a jped image data. As we know we cannot open it so, let's download it on to our local machine.

-> Convert the decoded file into base64 and copy the output and paste it onto a file in your local machine using text editor of your choice (nano, gedit, vim,etc).

# iris@venus:/tmp/..eloise$ base64 decode
# /9j/4AAQSkZJRgABAQEAYABgAAD/4RDSRXhpZgAATU0AKgAAAAgABAE7AAIAAAAEc01MAIdpAAQA                                          # AAABAAAISpydAAEAAAAIAAAQwuocAAcAAAgMAAAAPgAAAAAc6gAAAAgAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA                                          # AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA                                          # AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA                                          # AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA.....                                                   # AooooAKKKKACiiigAooooAKKKKACiiigAooooAKKKKACiiigAooooAKKKKACiiigAooooAKKKKAP                                          # /9k=

-> Decode it but this time dump the output to a file with '.jpeg' extension.

# ┌──(amogha㉿Amogha)-[~/hackmyvm_venus]
# └─$ base64 -d decoded > decoded.jpeg

# ┌──(amogha㉿Amogha)-[~/hackmyvm_venus]
# └─$ ls
# data.txt  decoded  decoded.jpeg

-> You can open the browser and view the image.

# ┌──(amogha㉿Amogha)-[~/hackmyvm_venus]
# └─$ firefox decoded.jpeg

-> The text is what I typed manually after looking up the image. You can try to extract the text using online tools.
