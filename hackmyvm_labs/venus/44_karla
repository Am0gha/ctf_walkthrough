Mission 0x45:
User denise has saved her password in the image.

Soln:

-> Okay... Denise, let's see what we have here in your home directory.

# karla@venus:~$ ls
# flagz.txt  mission.txt  yuju.jpg

-> We cannot view the contents of the image 'yuju.jpg' file. Hence, convert it into base64 string using the following command :

# base64 yuju.jpg

-> Copy the ouput of the command into a file on you local machine, and save it as 'yuju.b64'. Don't bother with the name, keep it anything you like.

-> Decode the now 'yuju.b64' file and redirect the output to the original file name and it's extension.

# base64 -d yuju.b64 > yuju.jpg

-> Now open the file and you could see that it's just a picture of the birth of the venus...??? (Had to reverse search the image through google.)

-> That doesn't make any sense in itself. Lets try to print the strings present in the raw jpg file. Maybe we can find some luck in there.

-> We struck gold...!!! If we look at the beginning few lines of the output you could see in the '<rdf:Description rdf: about: ' field, we have a string that looks very similar to the passwords each level has. It should have contained something else, will dig deeper into that part.

-> There is another way of doing this. Using a tool called 'exiftool', you can install it onto your local linux based machines by running the following command:

# sudo apt install exiftool

-> The 'exiftool' is a forensic tool used to check the metadata of the given file. Execute the following command to check the metadata of the 'yuju.jpg' file.

# ┌──(amogha㉿Amogha)-[~/hackmyvm_venus/karla]

# Date/Time Original              : 2021:11:01 10:34:51.95

-> It gives you a lot of information ranging from the time of the file's creation, last time modified, image size, author, tools used to create the immage, source of the image, etc.
